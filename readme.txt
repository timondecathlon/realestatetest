Hi everyone

Thanks for watching my test case. Hope it's not so weird

All you need to do in order to get the result is to send simple GET request like this
 - https://ironlinks.ru/realestate/?salary=6000&kids=2&age=26&car=true
with parameters you want to calculate and you'll get JSON response

To run unit tests you need to have PHPUnit on your machine

Check out source code you can here https://github.com/timondecathlon/realestatetest

P.S Thanks for watching again

Best regards, Tim
